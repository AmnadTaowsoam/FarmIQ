- **Custom Area Support**: Ability to specify custom coordinates for any area in Thailand
- **High Resolution Data**: Up to 2km spatial resolution using TMD Domain 3

### üìä Weather Data
- **Current Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, pressure, rainfall, cloud cover
- **Extended Forecasts**: Up to 72-hour hourly forecasts with detailed meteorological data
- **Agricultural Metrics**: UV index calculation, solar radiation, agricultural impact assessment

### üö® Smart Alerts
- **Heavy Rain Warnings**: Automatic alerts for rainfall exceeding 35mm
- **Temperature Extremes**: Alerts for temperatures above 35¬∞C or below 15¬∞C
- **Strong Wind Warnings**: Notifications for winds exceeding 50 km/h
- **Disease Risk Assessment**: Fungal disease risk based on humidity and temperature combinations

### üå± Agricultural Impact Analysis
- **Irrigation Efficiency**: Calculated based on upcoming rainfall and humidity
- **Crop Growth Conditions**: Optimal growing condition assessment
- **Disease Risk Levels**: Automated risk calculation for plant diseases
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Context-specific farming advice

## API Integration

### TMD API Domains
The system supports all TMD API domains with different resolutions and forecast ranges:

| Domain | Resolution | Forecast Range | Update Frequency |
|--------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| 0      | 27km       | 126 days       | 6 hours         |
| 1      | 18km       | 10 days        | 3 hours         |
| 2      | 6km        | 72 hours       | 1 hour          |
| 3      | 2km        | 48 hours       | 1 hour          |

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: Set your TMD API token (if available)
VITE_TMD_API_TOKEN=your_tmd_api_token_here

# Development mode (uses mock service)
DEV=true
```

#### Service Selection
The system automatically chooses between real TMD API and mock service:
- **Production**: Uses real TMD API if `VITE_TMD_API_TOKEN` is provided
- **Development**: Uses mock service with realistic data patterns
- **Fallback**: Mock service if API token is unavailable

### Weather Service Usage

```typescript
import { weatherService, THAILAND_REGIONS } from '@/services/weather';

// Get weather for predefined region
const weatherData = await weatherService.getRegionWeather('Chiang Mai');

// Get weather for custom area
const customWeather = await weatherService.getCustomAreaWeather(
  'My Farm',
  18.5, 98.5,  // bottom-left coordinates
  19.0, 99.0   // top-right coordinates
);

// Generate weather alerts
const alerts = weatherService.getWeatherAlerts(weatherData);
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Raw TMD Data**: Direct API response with meteorological variables
2. **Data Transformation**: Unit conversions and aggregations
3. **Agricultural Analysis**: Impact calculations and risk assessments
4. **Alert Generation**: Context-aware warnings and recommendations
5. **UI Rendering**: Responsive components with loading states

### Key Components
- **WeatherPage.tsx**: Main weather dashboard component
- **TMDService**: Real API integration with error handling
- **MockTMDService**: Development service with realistic data patterns
- **Agricultural Impact Calculator**: Smart recommendations engine

## Benefits for Agricultural Users

### üéØ Precision Agriculture
- **Micro-climate Monitoring**: 2-6km resolution for precise local conditions
- **Irrigation Optimization**: Data-driven watering recommendations
- **Crop Protection**: Early warning system for adverse weather

### üìä Data-Driven Decisions
